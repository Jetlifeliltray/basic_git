						<p class="article_paragraph"class="float_left" >It was admired as being able to bring forth all ninjutsu. It was said that in times when the world is in disorder, a person is sent down from the heavens to become either a "God of Creation", who will calm the world, or a "Destroyer", who will reduce everything to nothingness.[1] The Rinnegan allows the user to use the Six Paths Technique.

The first person to possess the Rinnegan was the Sage of the Six Paths. Because of the Sage's mythical status, many people believed the Rinnegan was only a legend or a mutation. Because the Rinnegan was originally wielded by the Sage of the Six Paths, re-merging his bloodlines, that of the Senju and Uchiha, can lead to that person awakening this dōjutsu. This was proven when Madara Uchiha later awakened the dōjutsu by infusing Hashirama Senju's DNA into his body; however, it did not manifest until he was near the end of his natural lifespan. At some point after this, he would implant his eyes into Nagato — a young boy from with Senju lineage. Since it was given to Nagato by Madara, Obito Uchiha, being the partner to and given the guise of Madara, believes that he is entitled to taking the Rinnegan from Nagato's body after his death. He implants one of the Rinnegan in his left socket, replacing the Sharingan he sacrificed.</p>
